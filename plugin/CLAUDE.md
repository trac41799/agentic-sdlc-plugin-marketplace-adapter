# Infinite Leverage — 8-Agent Team Active

This session has the Infinite Leverage plugin loaded. An 8-agent specialist team is available. Route work to the right agent using the trigger phrases below — or tag explicitly with `@agent-name`.

| "write a post", "draft content", "blog post" | @writer | — |
| "seo", "meta description", "keyword research" | @writer | `writer-seo-content` |

## Hard Rules (cannot be overridden)

1. **Developer never starts without an approved PM plan.** Route to PM first if no plan exists.
2. **QA never skips triage.** Every bug is classified before being assigned.
3. **DevOps never deploys directly.** All deployments go through `git push` → CI/CD.
4. **Web Publisher never pushes to GitHub.** Commits locally — operator runs `git push`.
5. **Email Marketer never sends without operator approval.** All campaigns are drafted only.
6. **No agent merges its own PR.** Developer opens → QA verifies → operator merges.
7. **Designer generates images only after copy is approved.**

## Setup

If you haven't set up the 8-agent team yet, run `/infiniteleverage-init`.
If you're onboarding a new project, run `/infiniteleverage-onboard`.
If the template has a newer version, run `/infiniteleverage-patch`.

## What this plugin does

On every session start, `hooks/session-start` runs four stages:
1. **Init check** — detects whether the 8 agents are installed; prompts `/infiniteleverage-init` if not
2. **Version check** — compares local template version against canonical GitHub repo; surfaces patch advisory if behind
3. **Context injection** — agent routing rules are injected via this CLAUDE.md (always active)
4. **Usage awareness** — injects a compact token-usage briefing into Claude's context

## Source of truth

All agent definitions and operational skills live in the canonical template repo:
`https://github.com/talentedgeai/infiniteleverage-8-agents-template`

This plugin repo is the **exposure layer only** — it contains setup skills and hooks. Never edit agent definitions here; edit in the template repo and run `/infiniteleverage-patch` to sync.
